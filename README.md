# Anonymous-Chat-Bot

The idea raised for making this minor project to prank my friend, 
I used FastAPI framework to create this project, 
This bot works on IP address, 
You can also use this on your mobile devices, only if the computer and mobile are on same network.
If you would like to use it on different networks, you have to use tunnels to access.
You can use tunnels like pythonanywhere, Pinngy.com etc.

I attached a full document file of this project, access it for the entire information
